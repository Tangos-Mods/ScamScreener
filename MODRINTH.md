# ScamScreener 1.3.3

Performance and stability update focused on smoother gameplay, lower memory use, and more reliable long-session behavior.

## Fixed
- Fixed rare freeze/crash cases triggered by extreme or malformed chat patterns, especially when tying `/guild` Commands
- Fixed long-session slowdowns caused by chat/player history growing too much.
- Improved overall memory behavior during long play sessions.
- Smoothed out internal chat tracking so alerts and review context stay more consistent over time.
