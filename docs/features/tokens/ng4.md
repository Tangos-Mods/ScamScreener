# Feature Family: `ng4:`
`ng4:` features represent contiguous four-word phrases. They are more specific than shorter families and therefore tend to fire less often, but when they do fire they can provide strong evidence for repeated scam scripts.  This family is especially useful for capturing procedural language and multi-step prompts that are too long to be represented clearly by bigrams or trigrams. In exchange for that specificity, data sparsity becomes more relevant, so robust weighting and minimum-frequency filtering are important.  For debugging, unexpected instability in `ng4:` behavior usually points to distribution drift in phrasing rather than extraction bugs.
