# Feature Family: `ng5:`
`ng5:` features represent contiguous five-word phrases, the longest token family currently extracted. These features are the most specific lexical indicators and often correspond to near-template scam wording.  Because five-word phrases are rare, they should be interpreted as high-precision lexical hints rather than broad detectors. A single activated `ng5:` feature can be very informative, but only if the training set had enough repeated evidence to estimate a stable weight.  In tuning practice, keep `ng5:` weights conservative unless you have strong sample support. Overfitting in this family is easy if rare phrases are treated as universal indicators.
