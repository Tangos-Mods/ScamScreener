# Feature Family: `ng2:`
`ng2:` features represent contiguous two-word phrases. They are the broadest token family and usually provide the highest lexical coverage, because short phrase fragments appear more often than longer ones.  From a modeling perspective, `ng2:` features are useful for capturing local collocations such as urgency plus action terms, offer plus payment terms, or redirect plus platform terms. They are less specific than longer n-grams, but they help the model react early when a message starts to look suspicious.  When tuning, treat `ng2:` as high-recall lexical scaffolding. If false positives rise, it is usually better to reduce overactive bigram weights than to remove the entire family.
