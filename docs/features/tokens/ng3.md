# Feature Family: `ng3:`
`ng3:` features represent contiguous three-word phrases. They balance coverage and specificity and are often the most interpretable token family in moderation workflows.  Compared to bigrams, trigrams better encode intent shape because they preserve one extra word of context. This often separates generic trade chatter from manipulative phrasings that only become suspicious in a longer phrase.  In operational terms, `ng3:` features are usually strong candidates for manual review when you inspect top model factors, because they often map cleanly to recognizable chat templates.
