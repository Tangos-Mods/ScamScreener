Terms of Service (ToS)
Last Updated: 2026-02-19

By using this mod and its optional training data export flow, you agree to the following:

1. Consent and purpose

When you use the upload flow, the mod archives your local training CSV and guides you to upload it manually in the community Discord server.
Shared training data is used to improve scam detection and model quality.

2. Data scope

Training files are intended to contain chat content and derived scam-related labels/features only.
Do not include malware, executables, or unrelated personal data.

3. User-controlled upload

The mod does not automatically submit your file to Discord.
You decide whether to join the server and upload the archived file yourself.

4. Responsibility

By uploading, you confirm that:
- You have the right to share the data.
- You understand the file may include public multiplayer chat content.
- You accept that contributed training data may be retained for research and model training.

5. Disclaimer

Scam detection is probabilistic and may produce false positives or false negatives.
Warnings are automated assessments and should not be treated as guaranteed fact.

By continuing, you acknowledge that you have read and accepted these terms.
